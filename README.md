## Abstract
This project implements a weather monitoring system using IoT technology in two stations. Station 1 measures and sends data using Arduino, dust sensor, temperature humidity sensor, and LoRa module. Station 2 uses another LoRa module and ESP8266 to receive data. The system collects data on dust concentration, temperature, precipitation, and humidity, which is then transmitted to Blynk for users to monitor current weather conditions, view historical trends, and set alerts. This demonstrates the integration of LoRa, ESP8266, and Blynk for efficient weather monitoring.

## Introduction
IoT technology enables communication between humans and devices, impacting various industries. Weather stations provide updates on weather conditions and forecasts, but changing climates necessitate frequent updates. This project aims to develop a simple weather station using IoT, allowing users to access real-time weather information from anywhere with an internet connection.
